# Fundamentals Merger
The Fundamentals Merger has been created to allow for the merging of player data from multiple servers into a single Fundamentals player data file.

This has been created for the RetroMC & BetaLands merge scheduled to take place in Q3-4 of 2022.

This project uses Project Poseidon as a library for various things. This really isn't ideal and libraries should be manually specified.

Please note, this won't be maintained after RMC/BL have successfully merged and is just here for reference.
